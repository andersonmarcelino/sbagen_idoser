## AnesthesiaQH is the QuickHit version of our Anesthesia dose. It is designed to give you optimum effects in the least amount of time. Testers have called it a "short lived, but a crazy numbing experience." You can use it for any form of pain (toothache, headache, etc.) and it works great, or simply get it for a good example of what an i-doser dose can do. Just make sure your bed isn't far from your computer. Trust us.
