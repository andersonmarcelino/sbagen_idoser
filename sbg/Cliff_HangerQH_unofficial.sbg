## Cliff HangerQH is the QuickHit version of our Cliff Hanger dose. It is designed to give you optimum effects in the least amount of time. You are standing on the very edge of a bottomless cliff, your toes just slightly over the edge, but with your eyes closed. You know the cliff is there, you FEEL it is there, but you just can't SEE it. Veritgo sets in, the world spins ever so slightly, the air is thin but crisp, and you have that drunken hazy high feeling that you would normally only feel at high altitude, looking down like you were hanging from the edge of a cliff, the universe below. You may have a dizzy feeling, so please take this dose laying down. Not for the new doser, this dose should be considered advanced.
