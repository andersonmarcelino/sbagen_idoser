Open-source I-Doser, using SBaGen data files decrypted from I-Doser

I-Doser illegally sold a compiled-only version of SBAGen, an open-source utility for synchronizing brainwaves.

The I-Doser data files have been decrypted, and I added descriptions from their website.  This means that you can use a command-line [SBaGen for Mac, Windows, and Linux] to play the files or generate WAV files. You can also get an [android version], and listen to them on the go.

Here is a [qr code] for the android file (for easy install.)
