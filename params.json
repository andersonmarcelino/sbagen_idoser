{"name":"Sbagen idoser","body":"I-Doser [illegally sold a compiled-only version of SBAGen], an open-source utility for synchronizing brainwaves.  The I-Doser data files have been decrypted, and I added descriptions from their website.  This means that you can use a command-line [SBaGen for Mac, Windows, and Linux] to play the files or generate WAV files. You can also get an [android version], and listen to them on the go.\r\n\r\n## Usage On A Computer\r\n\r\nDownload [SBaGen for Mac, Windows, and Linux], and put the sbg directory from this repo in the same folder as sbagen binary. Run it on the command-line, from that directory, like this:\r\n\r\n`./sbagen sbg/lsd.sbg`\r\n\r\n## Usage On Android Phone\r\n\r\nDownload the app using this [qr code], make sure you can install untrusted applications (in your phone's settings.) Put the sbg folder on your phone's SD card, and run the app. Locate the sbg folder, and choose an idoser file. Press the button at the bottom of the \"Sequence\" tab to run it.\r\n\r\n[SBaGen for Mac, Windows, and Linux]: http://uazu.net/sbagen/#download\r\n[android version]: http://www.normalesup.org/~george/comp/binaural_player/\r\n[qr code]: http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=200x200&cht=qr&chl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.normalesup.org%2F~george%2Fcomp%2Fbinaural_player%2FBinaural_player-20110318.apk\r\n[illegally sold a compiled-only version of SBAGen]: http://uazu.net/sbagen/i-doser.html","tagline":"Open-source I-Doser, using SBaGen data files decrypted from I-Doser","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
